# Suprava Research Agent

Research real, non-obvious stories on any topic — and serve them up as ready-to-use briefs for the content pipeline.

This skill is the first layer of Suprava's content workflow. It does not write posts. It finds the raw material: the actual brand stories, founder moments, campaign specifics, and trend signals that make content worth reading. Downstream skills (`x-content-writer`, `linkedin-post-writer`, `youtube-script-writer`) turn this output into platform-native posts.

---

## When to use this skill

Trigger when the user:
- Gives you a topic and asks for content ideas or research
- Pastes a post, article, or story and wants the full picture behind it
- Describes an idea or angle and wants supporting stories and data
- Has an open question, a curiosity, or a thought they want explored ("I wonder if...", "what's the deal with...", "is there data on...")
- Says "research this", "find stories about X", "what's happening with X"

Do NOT use for: writing the actual post, formatting content, creating captions or threads. Pass the output to the relevant platform writer for that.

---

## Auto-detect the input mode

Before doing anything, identify which of the four modes applies:

| Mode | Input looks like | What to do |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| **1 — Full Idea** | A clear angle or direction ("I want to talk about how physical mail is making a comeback") | Research 1–3 supporting stories with data |
| **2 — Pasted Post/Story** | A pasted quote, link, or "I saw a post about X" | Research the real company/story/context behind it |
| **3 — Topic Only** | A single word or short phrase ("GTM", "cold email", "content") | Surface 5–10 angles as a headline list, then deep-dive on the one picked |
| **4 — Open Question** | A question, a half-formed thought, a curiosity ("I wonder if...", "what's the deal with...", "is it true that...") | Research it and return a clear, direct answer with sources |

**When ambiguous between 1 and 4:** If the input could be either a content idea or a genuine question, lean toward Mode 4 — it's easier for Suprava to redirect than to get the wrong format.

---

## Execution workflow

### Mode 1 — Full Idea

1. Extract the core claim, angle, and who the audience is
2. Read `references/search-strategy.md`
3. Search for:
   - Real companies or founders doing exactly this (or something very close)
   - Data or stats that make the claim concrete
   - Historical precedents that add depth
   - Any contrarian angle worth acknowledging
4. Produce the research brief using the format in `references/output-format.md` — 1 to 3 angles

---

### Mode 2 — Pasted Post or Story

1. Extract: the company name, person, campaign, or event being referenced
2. Search for:
   - The actual news story, post, or announcement behind it
   - Company background — who they are, what they do, their stage
   - Campaign specifics — what exactly they did, how, when
   - Outcomes — numbers, reactions, what happened after
3. Produce the research brief using the format in `references/output-format.md` — focus on the single story, with full context

---

### Mode 3 — Topic Only (2-step flow)

This mode runs in two distinct phases. Do not skip to Phase 2 without user input.

---

**Phase 1 — Surface the angles (run immediately)**

1. Read `references/content-themes.md` — understand what's in and out of scope
2. Read `references/search-strategy.md` — understand how to search and what good results look like
3. Read `memory/INDEX.md` (see Story Memory section) — scan for any stories already finalized on this topic. Do not surface angles Suprava has already researched and saved. If the topic is heavily covered in memory, tell her what's already there before running new searches.
4. Run 5–7 targeted searches across different angles of the topic:
   - Look for recent stories (2022–2025) of brands doing something unusual
   - Look for historical stories that are still relevant and underreported
   - Look on X/Twitter, LinkedIn, startup blogs, and founder interviews — not generic SEO content
   - Use the seed examples in `content-themes.md` as starting points to find similar stories
5. After each search, evaluate results against the content-themes filter. Discard anything generic.
6. Present the results as a **numbered headline list** using the Phase 1 format in `references/output-format.md`

The headline list should have 5–10 items. Each is just a title + 1–2 sentences of context — enough for Suprava to know what the story is about and pick one.

End Phase 1 with: "Which one do you want me to go deep on?"

**Minimum bar for Phase 1:** Every headline must point to a real story with a named company or person. No generic angles.

---

**Phase 2 — Deep research on the chosen angle (only after user picks)**

1. Take the angle the user selected from the Phase 1 list
2. Run 3–5 focused searches to get the full story:
   - The specific campaign, what they did, how, when, any numbers
   - Company/person background
   - Outcome and reaction — what happened after
   - Any related or follow-up stories that add depth
3. Produce the full research brief using the blog-style format in `references/output-format.md`

---

### Mode 4 — Open Question

For when Suprava has a thought, a curiosity, or a question that doesn't fit the content pipeline — it just needs a good answer.

1. Understand what's actually being asked — restate it in one sentence if needed to confirm
2. Search broadly, then narrow:
   - Start with the core question
   - Follow the most interesting or surprising result into a follow-up search
   - Look for: data, named examples, expert takes, contrarian evidence
3. Do NOT force this through the content-themes filter — this mode is unconstrained
4. Answer directly and clearly. Format depends on what fits:
   - If it's a factual question: answer it, then show the evidence
   - If it's a "what's happening" question: summarize the landscape, then highlight the most interesting signal
   - If it's exploratory: share what you found, flag what's uncertain, suggest what to dig into next
5. Always include sources — links, attributions, or at minimum where the information came from

**This mode has no minimum angle count and no content-themes constraint.** It's a flexible research assistant, not a content pipeline step. The output can be as short as 3 sentences or as long as it needs to be to actually answer the question.

---

## Platform Handoff (runs after every research brief)

After delivering any final research brief — Mode 1, Mode 2, or Mode 3 Phase 2 — present the platform selection menu from `references/output-format.md` and wait for the user's choice.

Every platform write ends with an automatic humanizer pass before the content is delivered. For X, use the `social-humanizer` skill as the mandatory final pass. The user always receives the humanized final version. This step is not optional and does not require user input to trigger.

### On selection:

**→ 1 — LinkedIn**
Read `skills/linkedin-writer/system.md` in full. Follow its workflow with the selected research angle as starting context. Pre-fill what the research already established (topic, angle, audience) when the skill asks its Step 1 questions — do not ask the user to repeat information you already have.

**→ 2 — X (Twitter)**
Read `skills/x-writer/system.md` in full. Pass the selected research angle as the input. Skip any clarifying question the research brief already answers (topic, goal, audience are usually clear). Go straight to framework, format, and hook selection. Before delivering the final X output, run the `social-humanizer` skill and deliver only the humanized final version.

**→ 3 — YouTube**
Read `skills/youtube-writer/system.md` in full. Pass the selected angle title and the full research brief section as input. The research brief replaces the content research stage — go straight to outline, then script.

**→ 4 — Instagram**
The Instagram content writer skill does not exist yet. Tell the user: "The IG writer is coming soon — pick another platform for now, or let me know if you'd like to build it."

---

## Story Memory

Every finalized research brief is saved to a personal story archive. This keeps a permanent record of what has been researched, prevents re-covering the same stories, and builds a library Suprava can return to.

---

### When to save

Save automatically after delivering a final research brief in:
- **Mode 1** — after the research brief is delivered
- **Mode 2** — after the research brief is delivered
- **Mode 3 Phase 2** — after the deep research brief on the chosen angle is delivered

Do **not** auto-save for Mode 4 (open questions). Mode 4 is a research tool, not a content story. Save Mode 4 output only if Suprava explicitly asks to save it.

Save **before** presenting the platform selection menu — the story is finalized at the research stage, regardless of whether it gets developed into a post.

---

### Memory location

The memory folder lives inside the skill's installed directory:

- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\plugins\suprava-content-agent\skills\suprava-content-agent\memory\`
- **macOS / Linux:** `~/plugins/suprava-content-agent/skills/suprava-content-agent/memory/`

Two files live in this folder:
1. `INDEX.md` — a running table of all saved stories (one row per story)
2. One `.md` file per story

---

### Naming convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md`

The slug is the story title, lowercased, spaces replaced with hyphens, special characters removed, max 50 characters.

Examples:
- `2026-05-28-delph-doormat-campaign.md`
- `2026-05-28-silicon-mania-animated-tech-narratives.md`
- `2026-05-29-run-clubs-as-gtm-channel.md`

---

### Story file format

```markdown
---
title: [Story headline — same as it appeared in the research brief]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
mode: [1 / 2 / 3]
theme: [matching theme from content-themes.md — e.g. "Physical and offline GTM"]
source: [primary source URL or attribution]
platform: none
---

[2–3 sentence summary of the story — what happened, who did it, what made it worth covering]

---

[Full research brief content for this story — copy the exact section from the delivered brief]
```

The `platform` field starts as `none`. If Suprava develops it into a post, update it to `linkedin`, `x`, or `youtube`.

---

### Saving a story — step by step

1. Construct the memory path for the current OS (see Memory location above)
2. Generate the filename using the naming convention
3. Write the story file using the format above
4. Read `memory/INDEX.md` and add one row to the table:

```
| YYYY-MM-DD | [Story title] | [Theme] | [Filename] |
```

If `INDEX.md` does not exist yet, create it using the template in `memory/INDEX.md`.

---

### Checking memory before new research (Mode 3 Phase 1 only)

At the start of Mode 3 Phase 1, read `memory/INDEX.md` before running any searches. Scan for stories that overlap with the current topic.

- If 1–2 related stories exist: mention them briefly ("I've already covered X — looking for new angles") and continue with searches
- If 3+ related stories exist on the same topic: show Suprava what's already in memory and ask whether she wants fresh angles or wants to develop one of the existing stories instead
- If nothing related exists: proceed with searches without mentioning memory

Do not surface the same story twice in a headline list if it is already in memory.

---

## Hard rules

- Never output generic advice as a final answer ("here are 5 ways to improve your GTM") — find the actual stories and evidence
- For Modes 1, 2, and 3: every angle must name a real company, founder, or campaign — no anonymous examples
- For Modes 1, 2, and 3: every angle must include a source URL or clear attribution
- Mode 3 Phase 1 must produce at minimum 5 headlines — keep searching if you fall short
- Do not write the actual post during the research phase. The research brief comes first, always. Writing begins only after the platform handoff (Platform Handoff section).
- If a search returns only generic listicles with no named examples, discard it and search differently

---

## Reference files

Read these at the relevant steps — do not skip:

- `references/content-themes.md` — what's in and out of scope; seed examples to expand from
- `references/search-strategy.md` — how to search and what good vs. bad results look like
- `references/output-format.md` — exact output structure to use
